		What are permission levels

		<p>
			There are 3 permission levels available
			<br />
			They determine what each user can do in terms of admin rights
			<br />
			'Advanced Admin' can do everything
			<br />
			'Basic Admin' cannot add or remove users
			<br />
			'Basic' has no admin rights
			<br />
			The point of this is to restrict users who managers do not want to have access to important
			admin changes
			<br />
			The admin level is set when an account is created
			<br />
			Currently, to change an admin level, an account needs to be removed and then re-created with the
			new level
			<br />
			We are working on a new feature to make updating admin levels easier

		How to do a bank reconciliation
	</div>
	<div id="fitha" class="helpBody">
		<p>
			Bank reconciliations is the process of ensuring the correct amounts of money have been paid and
			recieved,
			<br />
			and to assign each new payment in your bank account with the outstanding payments in your
			accounting software
			<br />
			To complete this task using Basic Accounting, you will need to have a bank statement from your
			bank available
			<br />
			You need to go through each row on the bank statement, and search for the outstanding payment in
			the Bank Rec report on Basic Accounting
			<br />
			Once you have found the outstanding payment, you need to tick the checkbox, and this payment
			will be moved to the bank rec form
			<br />
			Once all payments on the bank statement have been ticked off on the bank rec repirt, you will
			need to submit the report
			<br />
			If you cannot find a payment that has been received on yopur bank statement (in your bank) on
			the bank rec report, this means the invoice has not been registered,
			<br />
			or, the invoice has already been paid, and this is a duplicate payment
			<br />
			If there are invoices on the bank rec report that are not on the bank statement, this means the
			invoices have not yet been paid.
			<br />
			Using Basic Accounting's Bank Rec reports, you can search the outstanding payments by using our
			client code filter, or the invoice number filter, or both!
			<br />
			You can see a list of the currently ticked off invoices by going to the "Current Rec" tab
			<br />
			Once you are happy with the current reconciliation, you can click on "Post Bank Rec", and the
			reonciliation will be saved
